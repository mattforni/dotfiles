# Learned Rules

Rules added from triage corrections. Read on every invocation. These override default rules in reference/triage-rules.md.

## Sender Rules

- `scheduling@acuityscheduling.com` (NAOSU SAUNA) -> 🍏 Constitution/🧖 Personal Care (NOT Athlete)

## Subject Rules

## Behavior Rules

- **CRITICAL: Check the actual system time before writing time-of-day greetings.** Do not assume morning/afternoon/evening. Run `date` or check the clock. This has caused errors in sent emails that cannot be corrected.
- When someone asks for availability to schedule a call/meeting, default to sharing the Reclaim scheduling link rather than proposing specific time slots. It's simpler and always up to date.
- When the user has reviewed and approved email drafts, send them directly if asked. Do not insist on creating drafts first. The review already happened in conversation.
- Stars mean action is needed from the user. Do not star informational emails. When in doubt whether an email needs action, read the full content first before assigning a star. A 1099 "available online" notice is informational (Coinbase handles it), not an action item.

## Domain Rules

- Precedence: apply exact sender rules first; apply these wildcard domain rules second for known high-confidence automations.
- `*@gusto.com` -> 🛠️ Craft/💼 Vocation; if about getting paid, also 🍏 Constitution/💰 Financial. Archive.
- `*@getsentry.com` (Sentry) -> 🛠️ Craft/💻 Development. Weekly reports: mark read, archive. Individual issue alerts: GREEN_STAR, keep in inbox.
- `*@email.claude.com` (Claude Team) -> 🛠️ Craft/💻 Development. Archive. Also add link to Notion AI Research page (3326231ededc809caebdd0c8dc22297d) under "# Claude Team Emails" heading. Link title = email subject.
- `*@billerpayments.com` (DHMP/Denver Health) -> 🍏 Constitution/🏥 Healthcare. Archive.
- Anthem Blue Cross (`*@anthem.com`) -> 🍏 Constitution/🏥 Healthcare + 📑 Admin/🧾 Bills. Autopay, archive.

## Todoist Rules

- When triaging notes/bookmarks that get moved to their proper location (Notion, Eudaimonia, etc.), delete the Todoist task. Do not complete it. These were never real tasks.

## Calendar Rules

- Never move, reschedule, or delete existing calendar events without explicit permission. Always present the proposed change and wait for approval.
- Events booked via Reclaim.ai scheduling links were scheduled by other people. Extra caution required.
- Deleting or moving adjacent events can cause Reclaim to auto-reschedule nearby flexible events as a side effect. Warn about this.
