# Triage Rules

Classification rules for inbox email triage. Read email-rules.md and learned-rules.md first; those override anything here.

## Purchase Detection

Auto-process (label, mark read, archive) when ANY of these match:

**Sender patterns** (case insensitive):

- `*@amazon.com`, `*@amazon.co.*`
- `*@shopify.com`, `*@myshopify.com`
- `*@paypal.com`, `*@paypal.co.*`
- `*@stripe.com`
- `*@square.com`, `*@squareup.com`
- `*@apple.com` with receipt/order in subject
- `noreply@*` with order/shipping/delivery in subject
- `*@ups.com`, `*@fedex.com`, `*@usps.com`, `*@dhl.com`

**Subject patterns** (case insensitive, any of):

- "order confirmation", "order shipped", "order delivered"
- "shipping confirmation", "shipping notification", "tracking number"
- "your receipt", "payment receipt", "invoice"
- "out for delivery", "delivery notification"
- "your order has", "thank you for your order"

**Known purchase senders** (from inbox research):

- `noreply@olo.com` (Illegal Pete's orders)
- `care@sijohome.com` (Sijo orders/shipping)
- `info@info.quince.com` (Quince orders/shipping)
- `webmaster@groomsgrotto.com` (The Grotto menswear)
- Cozy Earth
- Any Shopify-powered store (check headers)

**Multi-label purchases** (get Purchases + a second label):

- `invoice+statements@mail.anthropic.com` -> also `🛠️ Craft/💻 Development` (Anthropic receipts)
- `noreply@singenuity.com` -> also `🛠️ Craft/🌏 Adventure` (Cajun Encounters, tour bookings)
- Tech tools/dev subscriptions -> also `🛠️ Craft/💻 Development`

Target: `📑 Admin/🛒 Purchases`. Always mark read and archive.

## Star Rules

Star semantics are governed by the "Star semantics" rule in email-rules.md (Star Semantics): the star answers "who has the ball." Do not restate the definitions here; that rule is the single source of truth.

**Core behavior:**

- Never star emails that get archived. Stars mean action is needed.
- Always mark emails as read when archiving. Remove both INBOX and UNREAD together.

## Family Rules

Family emails always get surfaced for response, regardless of content.

**Known family senders:**

- `mfornaciari2000@yahoo.com` Michael Fornaciari (dad): Likes to send articles and links. Read the full content, summarize the article/topic, offer to draft a warm, appreciative reply.
- Any sender in `🤝 Community/👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Family` label history

**Handling:**

1. Label `🤝 Community/👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Family`
2. Yellow or red star (red if >3 days old)
3. Read full email content
4. Present overview to user
5. Offer to draft reply
