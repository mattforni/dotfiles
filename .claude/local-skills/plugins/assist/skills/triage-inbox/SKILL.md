# Triage Inbox

Get the Gmail inbox to a settled state. Every email gets exactly one decision, then leaves the inbox. Anything that needs a response gets a drafted reply; anything that needs action but no response becomes a Todoist follow-up; everything else is filed or deleted. The inbox is never a to-do list.

The work runs in two passes. **First a silent prep pass**: scan and classify every email, and prepare its artifact (a draft reply, a follow-up task, or a filing decision). **Then a review pass**: walk the prepared queue one at a time for approval, and execute each decision on the user's call. Prep is batched; every mutating action (send, label, star, archive, create task) is the user's, one email at a time. This one-at-a-time discipline is load-bearing (see the governing rule in learned-rules.md); never present a consolidated bulk plan or batch-approve.

## The Verb Model

Assign each email one verb. This is the entire decision tree.

| Verb | When | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| **Delete** | Noise, no future value | Unsubscribe (if a marketing list) then trash; a bare promo defaults to trash, not archive |
| **Archive** | No action, may want later | Label to the most specific sublabel, archive, no star |
| **Do** | A reply that truly takes under 2 minutes | Draft the reply for approval, send on approval, then label + archive |
| **Wait** | Ball is in someone else's court | Green star, keep in inbox to track |
| **Defer** | Action on us, more than 2 minutes | Create a Todoist follow-up, yellow star (red if overdue), then keep or archive |

Most inbox mail is Delete or Archive; lean toward getting things out. Stars encode who has the ball (green = them, yellow/red = us) per the governing star rule.

## Setup

1. Read [learned-rules.md](../../learned-rules.md) (corrections override everything below), then [triage-rules.md](../../reference/triage-rules.md) and [label-map.md](../../reference/label-map.md) for classification and routing.
2. Resolve label name to ID mapping (needed for every modify call):

   ```bash
   gws gmail users labels list --params '{"userId":"me"}' --format json 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"
   ```

3. Pull the authoritative inbox:

   ```bash
   gws gmail users messages list --params '{"userId":"me","q":"in:inbox","maxResults":50}' --format json 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"
   ```

   Snapshot this set as the working batch. Triage that batch; mail that arrives mid-session (including the one-time-code and verification mail your own portal activity generates while you work) is a separate next batch, not chased now.

## Phase 1: Scan and Classify (silent prep)

For each message, fetch headers and classify. **Scan, do not deep-read.** Read the full body only when a verb depends on it (family mail, an ambiguous request, anything you intend to reply to).

```bash
# Headers for classification
gws gmail users messages get --params '{"userId":"me","id":"<ID>","format":"metadata","metadataHeaders":["From","Subject","Date","List-Unsubscribe"]}' --format json 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"
# Full body when a verb depends on it. Do NOT use `gws gmail +read` (it returns only the subject).
# The `snippet` field is the fastest gist; for full text decode the base64 text/plain part.
# For HTML-only mail, strip <style>/<script> before stripping tags, or just read the snippet.
gws gmail users messages get --params '{"userId":"me","id":"<ID>","format":"full"}' --format json 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"
```

Cross-reference each sender/subject against triage-rules.md and learned-rules.md, assign a verb, and prepare the artifact:

- **Needs a quick response** → compose the reply now so it is ready for the review pass. Check the clock (`date`) before any time-of-day greeting. Draft, never auto-send, when the recipient is a person. Family replies get no sign-off.
- **Needs a substantive or high-stakes response** (BD, negotiation, pricing, anything sensitive) → do not dash off an inline draft. Park it (yellow star, right label, keep in inbox) and hand to `assist:bd-email` or a focused drafting pass after triage. The Do verb is for quick replies only.
- **Needs action, no response** → read the body for any deadline, then prepare a Todoist follow-up (see Follow-ups below).
- **Reference or noise** → note the target label and disposition. Unsubscribe is orthogonal to disposition: a pure marketing promo is unsubscribe + trash; a wanted sender is unsubscribe + label + archive; a receipt (even one titled "Thank you!") is label to Purchases + archive.
- **Waiting on someone** → note a green star, keep in inbox.
- **Already triaged** (has user labels/stars from a prior pass, still in inbox) → set aside; do not re-process. But a newer email may resolve a prior item (an appointment completed, a reply received, a filing confirmed); surface those during review and close them (clear the star, archive). Recap the rest at the end.

As they surface, also note two inline side actions to raise during review: a sender appearing 3+ times that is worth a **filter**, and any sender with a **Notion or Calendar** side action in learned-rules.md. If there is something to update, do it during review; if not, skip it.

Do not act or present a bulk plan in this phase. Prep only.

## Phase 2: Review One at a Time

**Family first**, then everything else. Present each email individually via AskUserQuestion showing: sender, subject, a one-line "what it is," the proposed verb, and the prepared artifact (the draft reply text, the follow-up task, or the label + disposition). The user approves, modifies, or skips. Execute on their call, then move to the next.

- **When in doubt, ask.** If classification is ambiguous or an email could take multiple labels, ask rather than guess. Route to the most specific sublabel; an email can take more than one (an Anthropic receipt is Purchases + Development).
- **Sending replies**: only send to a person after explicit approval. Direct send is fine for automations, lists, and unsubscribe addresses. Never reference people or sources the user does not know.
- **Scheduling**: if an email proposes a date/time, check the calendar; if it works, offer to accept and send an invite; if not, propose an alternative (prefer Fridays for in-person). Default to sharing the Reclaim link rather than proposing slots.
- **Corrections**: when the user overrides a classification, append the rule to [learned-rules.md](../../learned-rules.md) under the right section with enough context to reuse.

Execute label/star/archive changes with `modify` (pass the full star set in `removeLabelIds` when archiving, per the governing star rule):

```bash
# Archiving strips the full star set (STARRED plus the colored-star system labels), per the governing star rule.
gws gmail users messages modify --params '{"userId":"me","id":"<ID>"}' --json '{"addLabelIds":["<LABEL_ID>"],"removeLabelIds":["INBOX","UNREAD","STARRED","YELLOW_STAR","GREEN_STAR","RED_STAR"]}' 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"
```

`modify` and `batchModify` return an empty body, so a `grep`/parse pipeline exits non-zero even on success. Do not read that as failure; confirm with a follow-up `messages get` (`format=minimal`).

### Replies

Draft and send threaded replies with the `+reply` helper (it sets In-Reply-To / References / threadId and quotes the original). Never hand-roll base64 RFC2822.

```bash
gws gmail +reply --message-id <ID> --draft --body "<text>"   # save a draft for review (default for a person)
gws gmail +reply --message-id <ID> --body "<text>"           # send (only after explicit approval for a person)
```

### Follow-ups (Todoist)

For every Defer email, create a task (conventions in `~/Eudaimonia/Admin/tools/todoist.md`): short Title Case title with an emoji prefix and the Gmail link, details in a comment, due the **next Monday** as a bare date (date-only, never timed), omit `projectId` to land in the inbox. Do the actual work in the review pass on approval, not during prep. **Exception**: an item already past its deadline goes on a task due **today**, not the next Monday, and takes a red star.

### Unsubscribe

For a Delete-by-unsubscribe: read the `List-Unsubscribe` header (already fetched in Phase 1). If it has a `mailto:`, send to that address **using the exact `?subject=` value encoded in the mailto** (Klaviyo and other one-click lists reject a generic "Unsubscribe" subject; URL-decode it first). If only a URL, hand it to the user to visit; if neither, say so. Then apply the disposition (trash for a bare promo, or label + archive for a wanted sender).

```bash
# Extract the mailto address and its encoded subject from List-Unsubscribe; URL-decode the subject; then:
gws gmail +send --to "<unsubscribe-address>" --subject "<decoded-encoded-subject>" --body "Unsubscribe" 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"
```

### Filters

For a recurring sender worth a filter, propose it during review; on approval, create it and record it under `## Created Filters` in learned-rules.md to prevent duplicates. Default action: label, mark read, skip inbox.

```bash
gws gmail users settings filters create --params '{"userId":"me"}' --json '{"criteria":{"from":"<sender>"},"action":{"addLabelIds":["<LABEL_ID>"],"removeLabelIds":["INBOX"]}}' 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"
```

### Side actions

Some senders route content elsewhere (patterns in learned-rules.md), e.g. Claude Team emails get linked on the Notion AI Research page via `notion-fetch` then `notion-update-page`. Complete a side action before archiving its email.

**Keeper documents** (policies, legal docs, statements worth retaining) get filed to Google Drive, not just labeled. The doc is often a portal/download link in the body, not an attachment, so follow the link (confirm it resolves to the file, e.g. `application/pdf`). Find the matching project folder, read its existing filenames to learn the naming schema (e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD - NN - Description`), then upload with that schema, verify, and archive the email:

```bash
gws drive files list --params '{"q":"'\''<FOLDER_ID>'\'' in parents and trashed=false","fields":"files(name)","orderBy":"name"}' --format json 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"  # learn the schema
gws drive +upload "<local-file>" --parent "<FOLDER_ID>" --name "<YYYY-MM-DD - NN - Description.ext>" 2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"
```

## Phase 3: Wrap

1. **Red-star digest**: list every email still carrying a red star (sender, subject, age, what it needs). This is the "respond to these" list.
2. **Recap**: counts by verb (deleted, archived, replied, deferred to Todoist, waiting), plus filters created, side actions done, and any already-triaged mail left in place.
3. **Learned rules**: confirm any corrections captured this session landed in learned-rules.md.

## gws Notes

All Gmail work goes through the `gws` CLI via Bash. Every call prints `Using keyring backend: keyring` to stderr, so pipe through `2>&1 | grep -v "^Using"` before any JSON parse. Use `gws gmail users messages list` (not `+triage`) for the canonical inbox set.
