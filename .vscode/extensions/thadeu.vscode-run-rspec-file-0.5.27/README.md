## Settings

### Custom command

You might want to prefix the rspec command with something like docker or foreman.

With this configuration you can customize your rspec command as you please. Example when using foreman:

```json
{
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.custom-command": "foreman run bundle exec rspec --color"
}
```

### Custom folder

You want to work in other folder. With this configuration you can customize rspec command to run a custom folder.

```json
{
  "vscode-run-rspec-file.folder": "test"
}
```

### Custom Suffix File

You want to work with other suffix file, for exemplo, if you use Minitest, you set `_test.rb` suffix. So, with this configuration you might customize suffix file. 

```json
{
    "vscode-run-rspec-file.suffix": "test"
}
```

The default is `bundle exec rspec --color`.

You can also customize it per project by adding the same configuration to your project's `.vscode/settings.json`.
