# Shared .account profile resolution.
#
# Sourced by ~/bin/claude, ~/bin/gws, and .functions, which all read the same
# `.account` marker convention and previously each carried their own copy of
# this logic. That duplication was not theoretical: a path traversal fix on
# 2026-08-07 had to be applied three separate times, and the bin/claude copy was
# missed twice before a review caught it. One copy, three callers.
#
# Contract:
#   account_resolve_profile   -> prints the profile name for $PWD, never empty
#   account_marker_profile    -> nearest .account marker, or empty
#   account_ambient_profile   -> ~/.config/gws-current, defaulting to home
#   account_valid_profile <s> -> exit status only
#
# Callers set ACCOUNT_LOG_PREFIX to label warnings, and ACCOUNT_QUIET=1 to
# suppress them. .functions sets ACCOUNT_QUIET because it resolves on every
# chpwd and would otherwise warn on every prompt inside a tree with a broken
# marker. Keep ACCOUNT_QUIET unexported so child processes stay loud.
#
# Must stay sourceable by both bash and zsh; .functions is read by both.

# A profile name is joined straight into "$HOME/.config/gws-$profile" and
# "$HOME/.claude-$profile", so it has to be a single path component. Anything
# holding a slash or a dot could walk out of those directories. Reject rather
# than sanitize: a malformed marker silently resolving to another account is the
# exact failure the marker system exists to prevent.

# Read a one line profile name from a file. Prints nothing when the file is
# absent, empty, or holds a name that is not a single path component.
#
# The local is named `src`, not `path`, deliberately. In zsh `path` is a special
# variable tied to $PATH as an array, so `local path=...` clobbers command
# lookup for the rest of the function; any external command then fails to
# resolve and every marker silently reads as empty. Both shims are bash and
# never saw it. This library is the first copy zsh sources, so the trap is live
# here. Avoid zsh special names throughout: path, status, prompt, cdpath,
# manpath, dirstack, argv.
#
# Only leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed, never internal. Stripping
# every space would fold a marker reading "t pf" into the valid profile "tpf",
# selecting an account the file never named; internal whitespace instead falls
# through to the validator and is rejected loudly. Reading via $(<...) rather
# than an external command keeps this free of PATH entirely and lets an
# unreadable marker report its own error rather than vanishing into /dev/null.
