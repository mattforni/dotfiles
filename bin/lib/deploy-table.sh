# The single source of truth for what homebase deploys to $HOME.
#
# Sourced by setup.sh, which reconciles $HOME against it. It exists because this
# list used to be four lists that disagreed: a symlink allowlist in setup.sh, an
# rsync exclusion array, SYNC_FILES in .functions, and a hand-maintained subset
# in bin/claude-profiles-init.sh that had already drifted, missing agents, hooks
# and workflows. That fourth consumer retired with the Claude profile split on
# 2026-08-12 (ATE-463), leaving one table and one reader.
#
# Defines DEPLOY_TABLE, LEGACY_PATHS and MANIFEST. No side effects.
#
# Everything here is consumed by whoever sources the file, so static analysis
# sees each definition as an unused assignment. That is the nature of a library
# of declarations rather than a defect.

# How homebase reaches $HOME. This one table replaced four lists that used to
# disagree with each other: a symlink allowlist here, an rsync exclusion list in
# deploy_homebase, SYNC_FILES in .functions, and a fourth in the retired
# bin/claude-profiles-init.sh. Anything not named here is never deployed.
#
# Modes:
#   link   Symlink into the repo, so a git pull is live with no deploy step.
#          Only for paths nothing but a human or git ever writes. A tool that
#          saves by writing a temp file and renaming over the target REPLACES
#          the symlink with a regular file; Claude Code, VS Code and macOS
#          `sed -i` all do this, and the link is gone with no error.
#   copy   Plain file copy, for a tracked file living inside a directory that
#          receives foreign writes. Files only, never directories.
#   merge  JSON merge by top level key: keys the repo declares are replaced,
#          keys it does not are left alone. For files the owning app rewrites
#          for itself. A key the repo declares is replaced whole, so dropping an
#          entry from inside one (a permission out of permissions.allow) does
#          reach $HOME. Deleting an entire top-level key from the repo does NOT
#          remove it downstream: once undeclared it is indistinguishable from a
#          key the app owns. Delete those by hand, or add key tracking to the
#          manifest if that ever becomes common.
#
# Never link a directory that receives foreign writes. ~/.claude is the reason:
# it holds sessions, projects, history and credentials that Claude Code writes
# constantly, so its tracked children are listed individually instead.
#
# Format: mode|repo path[|destination]. Destination defaults to the repo path
# relative to $HOME; an absolute destination is used verbatim.
