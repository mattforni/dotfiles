# The Retro Runner

A Cloud Run Job (`retro`, project `atelic`, region `us-central1`) that fires every Monday at 05:00 Denver, pulls the ISO week from Strava, Gmail, and HubSpot with curl, has headless Claude Code draft the retrospective as JSON, renders it into the branded email with `render.jq`, and sends it through Resend as `YYYY-Www Retro`. Read only against the world except the rotated Strava refresh token, which it writes back to the vault. Tracked as ATE-471.

The runtime one pager (why Cloud Run over Routines and launchd, the service account and its secrets, the schedule, the traps) lives in Eudy at `Admin/Tools/cloud-run.md`.

**Iterate locally first.** The loops and the promote step are in [../README.md](../README.md); the short version is `bin/runner/render-local retro` while changing how the email looks, `bin/runner/run-local retro --reuse` while changing what it says, and `bin/runner/promote retro` once it is right.

```bash
bin/runner/fetch-env retro                 # once per machine
bin/runner/run-local retro --week 2026-W35 # renders to out/, sends nothing
bin/runner/render-local retro              # instant re-render after a render.jq edit
bin/runner/promote retro                   # build and point the job at it
bin/runner/fire retro                      # run production now
```

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` | `node:20-slim` plus curl, jq, tzdata, and a pinned Claude Code; runs as the non root `runner` user |
| `entrypoint.sh` | The pulls, the `claude -p` call (Read as its only tool), the render, the send, and the Strava write back |
| `prompt.md` | The retro brief: the block's grading, the JSON shape, the voice rules; `{{WEEK}}`, `{{MONDAY}}`, `{{SUNDAY}}`, `{{TODAY}}`, `{{WORK}}` are filled at run time |
| `render.jq` | The email template: Geist on cream with one orange accent, Gmail safe tables, every style inline |
